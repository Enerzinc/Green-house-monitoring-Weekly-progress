# Week 2 Progress – Schematic Design

## Overview
For Week 2, the group completed the full schematic design for the automatic greenhouse system. This schematic serves as the hardware blueprint, showing how each sensor, actuator, and module is interconnected.

## Completed Tasks
- Created the complete wiring schematic of all components  
- Assigned proper input/output pins for all sensors and actuators  
- Mapped power distribution lines to ensure stable operation  
- Verified voltage compatibility for the 6V pump, sensors, and microcontroller  
- Integrated the motor driver, servo motor, and ESP module into the design  
- Reviewed the schematic to ensure no wiring conflicts or missing connections
