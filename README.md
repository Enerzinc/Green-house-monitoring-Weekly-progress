# Week 1 Progress – Plamtelligence Greenhouse Project

## Overview
This folder contains the Week 1 progress for our Automatic Greenhouse project. During this week, the team focused on **planning, testing, and verifying the sensors** that will be used in the system.

## Sensors Tested
The following sensors were tested to ensure proper functionality:

- DHT11/DHT22 (Humidity & Temperature Sensor) – Monitors the internal climate of the greenhouse.
- Soil Moisture Sensor – Detects soil dryness for automated watering.
- Rain Sensor – Detects rainfall or water presence.
- Light Sensor (LDR)– Measures light intensity to manage shading or artificial lighting.

## Draft Login System
The team created a draft front-end design for the login system, focusing on a simple, clean, and user-friendly interface that allows users to securely enter their credentials. The layout includes:

- Username and password input fields
- Login button
